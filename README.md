# openlane_build_script
This script builds openlane and all its dependencies on an Ubuntu (only) System.
The scripts in this repo are:
 - openlane_script.sh
 - openlane_script_wo_depends.sh
 
**openlane_script.sh** is a standalone script where it builds openlane (latest version) and all its dependencies; while **openlane_script_wo_depends.sh** works in conjunction with [vsdflow script](https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow) and builds only openlane (hence lesser run-time).

# STEPS TO BUILD OPENLANE

1. `git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script`
2. `sudo -i` #switch to root user (or have root user password ready).
3. Change directory to where openlane_build_script folder was cloned. `cd /path/to/openlane_build_script`
4. Execute the script as below:

      - **For standalone build**
       
        - `chmod 775 openlane_script.sh`
        - `./openlane_script.sh`
     
      - **For build in conjunction with vsdflow**
       
        -  Copy the `openlane_script_wo_depends.sh` to vsdflow folder.
        - `chmod 775  openlane_script_wo_depends.sh`
        - `./openlane_script_wo_depends.sh`
      
5. This script would create following directory structure:

- **For build in conjunction with vsdflow**
```bash 
vsdflow/
  └── work
     └── tools
      ├── cmake-3.13.0
      ├── cmake-3.13.0.tar.gz

```
- **For standalone build**
 ```bash

    └── tools 
        └── openlane_working_dir
         |__ Openlane
                       
```              
 
# STEPS TO RUN OPENLANE

1. Go to /path/to/openlane (i.e., ~/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/Openlane)
2. There are two ways of invoking openlane. The easiest of the two would be:
   - `make mount`

   The second way would be to explicitly specify the path to PDK_ROOT and OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME and invoking docker with these inputs
   - `export PDK_ROOT=<absolute path to where skywater-pdk and open_pdks reside>`
   - `export OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME=<docker image name>`
   - `docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openlane -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) $OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME`
   
3. **Note:** If you face "permission denied" during docker invocation in setup or in above step, do refer below link to resolve:
   - [Fix Docker Permission Denied Issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48957195/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-issue)

4. `./flow.tcl -design spm`
(the above flow.tcl command will run RTL2GDS flow for design named "spm". Same can be done for other designs which are present in ~/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/Openlane/designs)
